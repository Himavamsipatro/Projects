                    Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valley (with hill ranges' elevation varying from 800 to 1,300 m
                    (2,600 to 4,300 ft)) of the Alluri Sitharama Raju district in Andhra Pradesh. The caves, one of the
                    largest in the country, at an elevation of about 705 m (2,313 ft), distinctly exhibit a variety of
                    speleothems ranging in size and irregularly shaped stalactites and stalagmites. The caves are
                    basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 80 m (260 ft), and are considered the
                    deepest caves in India. The native name for the caves is Borrā Guhalu where Borra means
                    abdomen in and Guhalu means caves in Telugu language.
                    Borra is Telugu word in native North Andhra dialect which means hole('Boriya' in standard Telugu).
                    On the discovery of the caves, there are several legends, which the tribals (Jatapu, Porja,
                    Kondadora, Nookadora, valmiki etc.) who inhabit the villages around the caves narrate. The
                    popular legend is that a cow, grazing on the top of the caves, dropped 60 m (200 ft) through a hole
                    in the roof. The cowherd while searching for the cow came across the caves. He found a stone inside
                    the cave that resembled a Lingam, which he interpreted as the Lord Shiva who protected the cow.

        The village folk who heard the story believed it and since then they have built a small temple for Lord Shiva
        outside the cave. People flock to the temple for worship and the cave to get a glimpse of the Lingam.
        Another lyrical legend is that the Shiva Lingam representing the Hindu God Lord Shiva, is found deep in the
        caves and above which is a stone formation of a cow (Sanskrit: Kamadhenu). It is surmised that the udder of this
        cow is the source of the Gosthani (Sanskrit: Cow's udder) River which originates from here, flows through
        Vizianagram and Visakhapatnam districts before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Bheemunipatnam.Another
        lyrical legend is that the Shiva Lingam representing the Hindu God Lord Shiva, is found deep in the caves and
        above which is a stone formation of a cow (Sanskrit: Kamadhenu). It is surmised that the udder of this cow is
        the source of the Gosthani (Sanskrit: Cow's udder) River which originates from here, flows through Vizianagram
        and Visakhapatnam districts before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Bheemunipatnam.[6]
        The caves are located in the Araku Valley of the Ananthagiri hill range and is drained by the Gosthani River. At
        the entry, the cave measures up to 100 m (330 ft) horizontally and 75 m (246 ft) vertically. Stalagmite and
        stalactite formations are found in the caves.
